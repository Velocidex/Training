## Module overview

* We previously saw how Velociraptor can be used to triage, collect
  indicators and remotely analyze a system.
* Sometimes we can not deploy the Velociraptor client/server model but
  we still want to be able to collect artifacts.
* Sometimes we need to rely on another agent to actually do the
  collection (either a human agent or another software).
* This module shows how to prepare Velociraptor for local, interactive
  triage collection - simply collect the relevant artifacts and ship
  them out.
