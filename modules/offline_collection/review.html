## Review And Summary

* Collecting data from the endpoint is a balancing act:
   1. Collecting too much data makes it difficult to post process
   2. Collecting too little means frequent re-collections and pivoting.

* In Client/Server model it is easy to hunt for new data quickly
   * It is better to be more targeted and answer more specific questions
   * Limit the total data returned

* We saw to to collect uploads using SMB and S3
   * More methods are available (SFTP, Azure etc).
   * The basic principal is the same: Lock down the service account so
     it can only upload

## Local collection considerations

* Local collection can be done well without a server and permanent
  agent installed.

* A disadvantage is that we do not get feedback of how the collection
  is going and how many resources are consumed.

* We really need to plan ahead what we want to collect and it is more
  difficult to pivot and dig deeper in response to findings.
