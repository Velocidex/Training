## Review And Summary

* Many modern attacks are only present in memory
* Velociraptor is able to gather volatile machine state
* We learned sophisticated process visbility plugins:
   * Process tokens
   * Analyzing PE files from memory
   * Dumping memory resident injected binaries

## Review And Summary

* Other sources of machine state include:
 * Event Tracing for Windows
    * Event driven framework for being notified about changes in
      system state.

* Practical example: MSBuild based attacks.
