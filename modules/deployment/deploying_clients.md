## Deploying clients - Windows

* We typically distribute signed MSI packages which include the
  clientâ€™s config file inside them.  This makes it easier to deploy as
  there is only one package to install.

* Velociraptor can create the MSI to target the correct Org using the
  `Server.Utils.CreateMSI` artifact.

## Domain deployment

We can deploy the MSI to the entire domain using group policy.

Two Methods:
1. Via scheduled tasks.
2. Via assigned software.

Create a share to serve the MSI from.

<!-- .slide: class="full_screen_diagram small-font" -->

Ensure everyone has read access from this share - and only administrators have write access!

Use the group policy management tool create a new Group Policy Object in the domain (or OU)

Ensure the new scheduled task is run as system

Using scheduled tasks you can run any binary - use this method to run
interactive collection if you do not have a dedicated Velociraptor
server

Ensure the new scheduled task is run only once

Method 2: install via assigned software packages in GPO. The main
advantage here is that it is possible to upgrade or uninstall
Velociraptor easily

You will need to wait until group policy is updated on the endpoint or
until the next reboot. The endpoint must be on the AD LAN
