## Using Event Queries for monitoring

* Velociraptor's magic saurce is the VQL language
* VQL queries are asynchronous and stream results as soon as they are
  available
* This property makes VQL ideal for watching for real time events!
* In this module we learn how to apply event queries:
    * On the client - detection
    * On the server - automation
