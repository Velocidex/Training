## Module overview

* Velociraptor is a VQL evaluation engine
* Many features are implemented in terms of VQL so VQL is central!
* This module will focus on VQL understanding and demonstrate how it works internally.
* This module will use the notebook to evaluate VQL.
* Later we can leverage the same VQL across the network at scale!
