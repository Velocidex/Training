* VQL is the engine behind Velociraptor!
* This module covered the language in great details

* We learned about stored queries as a way of pre-compiling a query to be accessed on demand later.

## Review

* We saw how VQL is lazy and will perform the least amount of work necessary to evaluate the query
* We can use this property to control query cost and side effects.
* We learned about some of the most useful VQL plugins (foreach(), switch(), if())

* We learned about event queries and how to use asynchronous VQL queries.
